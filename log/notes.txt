Go through the starter variables below.
Draw exploratory plots, look for outliers, check distribution etc.
Investigate how to handle MSSubClass? It's catgeorical but given as int.

OverallQual - rsquared = 0.79
GrLivArea- rquared = 0.50
  TotalBsmtSF - rquared = 0.38

Other:
Potential to combine variables:
- GarageQual + GarageCond
- OverallCond + OverallQual

To investigate:
- Condition1 & Condition2 (look similar?)
- YearBuilt
- BsmtFinType1 & BsmtFinType2
- YrSold
- is HouseStyle contianed in 11stFlrSF & 22ndFlrSF
