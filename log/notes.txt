Go through the starter variables below.
Draw exploratory plots, look for outliers, check distribution etc.
Investigate how to handle MSSubClass? It's catgeorical but given as int.

Starter Variables (in order of correlation):

SalePrice
  - skewness = 1.88
  - kurtosis = 6.54
  - After applying logs: Skew: 0.12, Kurt: 0.81
OverallQual
  - rsquared = 0.79
GrLivArea
  - rquared = 0.50
  - transformed to log scale
TotalBsmtSF
  - rquared = 0.38
  - skew: 1.5, kurt: 13.2
1stFlrSF = rquared =  0.37
2ndFlrSF
GarageCars
  - rsquared = 0.64
GarageArea
  - rsquared = 0.62
FullBath
  - rsquared = 0.56
  - 9 properties with no bathrooms?!
LotArea
  - skewness = 12.2
  - kirtosis = 203
  - After applying logs: Skew: -0.13, Kurt: 4.7
YearBuilt
Neighborhood
TotRmsAbvGrd
  - Skew:  0.68
  - Kurt:  0.88
  - Maybe need to look at binning TotRmsAbvGrd greater than 10. i.e. put 10-14
  together into 1 bin

PoolArea
  - only 7 properties with pools (don't include)



YrSold and SaleType showed little relationship with SalePrice


Other:
Potential to combine variables:
- GarageQual + GarageCond
- OverallCond + OverallQual

To investigate:
- Condition1 & Condition2 (look similar?)
- YearBuilt
- BsmtFinType1 & BsmtFinType2
- YrSold
- is HouseStyle contianed in 11stFlrSF & 22ndFlrSF

17/1: Features not lined up between training and testing. Fix this first!
